# 🏠 Mortgage Calculator (Built with Streamlit)

Hi there! 👋

This is my first ever Python project — a simple, interactive **mortgage repayment calculator** built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). I’m a finance professional who's recently started learning Python on the side, and this project helped me connect what I know about amortization with Python code.

## 💻 What It Does

- Takes in basic loan inputs (home value, deposit, interest rate, loan term)
- Calculates:
  - Monthly repayments
  - Total interest paid
  - Total repayments
- Displays an **amortization schedule** month-by-month
- Includes a **line chart** to visualize principal repayment over time

## 🚀 How to Run It

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install streamlit numpy_financial pandas

# Run the app
streamlit run mortgage_calc.py
